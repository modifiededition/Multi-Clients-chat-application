I have made this project on Intellij(IDE), so in order to run this project, you would need to  have intellij
or you can simply take the source code from the src file to run any of your favourite IDE.
We can do only texting for communication right now  with this project but can be extend this project to send media files like audio or video.
Or can make a database system for the clients so that they can also retrieve their data(like creating a backup) whenever they want.
This project is purely made for understanding how socket programming works in java.
